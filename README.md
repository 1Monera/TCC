# Fraud Detection Machine Learning Models - Final Paper

The final paper had a simple objective, to show a statistical analysis on a subject not covered directly on the major.
I decided to study fraud detection models because it had to do with a my current internship.
After finding an adequate dataset on Kaggle, I went through a few architectures on neural networks as well as other well known models.
